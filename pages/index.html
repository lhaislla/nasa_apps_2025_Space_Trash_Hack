            <p>
                The Space Trash Hack proposes innovative solutions to transform waste into valuable resources during missions to Mars.

            <ul>

                    Martian regolith: a loose, unconsolidated surface layer of dust, soil, and debris covering the surface of Mars, characterized as sterile, nutrient-poor, and containing the toxic substance perchlorate. Despite the challenges, it can be used in construction and possibly in water and oxygen extraction.

            <h2>A Data Solution</h2>
            <p>
                The future of long-duration space exploration, especially crewed missions to Mars, is intrinsically linked to the crew's self-sufficiency. In this context, waste management is no longer a secondary logistical issue and becomes a critical, ethical, and operational challenge. It is not acceptable for humanity to reproduce the problem of terrestrial landfills on another planet. Everything transported across millions of kilometers, such as food packaging and damaged equipment, must have intrinsic value to justify its weight and volume.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on this premise, the Recyclonauts project is the materialization of the Space Trash Hack concept, turning trash into treasure. The development of an intelligent and sustainable waste system is not only useful but absolutely critical to mission success.
            </p>
            <p>
                The urgency of this solution is evidenced by logistical data. On long-duration missions, such as the 550-day journey to the Red Planet, a crew of four astronauts generates about 6.4 kg of waste per day. This accumulation results in approximately 800 kg of solid waste, occupying up to 19 m³, equivalent to the pressurized volume of an Orion spacecraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this scenario, the app acts as an intelligent management system, rigorously applying the 3Rs—Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle—to every item taken. Recyclonauts uses AI-based image recognition to meticulously identify and classify the composition of waste. This analysis is critical, as it allows the recognition of material purity (such as Zotek F30 foam or structures with more than 90% aluminum) to then suggest the most efficient reuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                The importance of the system lies in transforming discarded material into input again. Recyclonauts provides functional suggestions so that the identified material serves as a basis for solutions in vital scenarios, whether habitat renovations (using packaging and foams), crew celebrations (creating decorations from packaging), or scientific experiments (such as using filters from damaged equipment). Thus, the app not only converts waste into vital resources; it enables the crew to plan the conversion into resources (such as 800 kg of O₂ and 900 kg of H₂O) or into new tools and structures, ensuring that the material taken to Mars has its value maximized, optimizing essential resources such as water, energy, and Martian regolith, and ensuring the sustainability of human presence beyond Earth.
